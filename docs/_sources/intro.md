# Welcome to RawToFigure

This documentation describes [echemdbs'](https://github.com/echemdb) take on research data management (RDM) from raw data to publishable figures.
We aim at providing a lightweight approach to annotating research data with metadata when raw data is created and create frictionless based datapackages ([unitpackages](https://echemdb.github.io/unitpackage/)) further usage.
These unitpackages can be used to browse your data locally based on descriptors provided in the medadata, for comparison with published data, for integration in data processing workflows, or for creation of entries in electronic lab notebooks (ELN).

## Example

Consider you record the following data as a {download}`data.csv <files/data/data.csv>`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('files/data/data.csv')
df
```

From the data it is unclear which units the values have, nor can you infer which voltage `U` has been measured or if it has been applied to something.
Such information is stored as additional metadata along with the csv automatically using [`autotag-metadata`](https://echemdb.github.io/autotag-metadata/), a tool which observes a folder for file changes and writes the metadata from a template.
For the above CSV the {download}`YAML <files/data/data.csv.meta.yaml>` could look as follows.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]
from IPython.display import Code

Code(filename='files/data/data.csv.meta.yaml', language='yaml')
```

There is no limitation on the amount of metadata stored along with your data as illustrated on the example of [echemdbs' metadata schema](https://github.com/echemdb/metadata-schema/blob/main/examples/file_schemas/autotag.yaml) for electrochemical data.

The CSV and YAML can be used to create a [unitpackage](https://echemdb.github.io/unitpackage/usage/unitpackage.html), a file standard which is based on [frictionless datpackages](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/). For our purpose we create unitpackages with [`echemdbconverters`](https://echemdb.github.io/unitpackage/usage/echemdb-converters.html), providing a simple command line interface (CLI).

```{code-cell} ipython3
!echemdbconverters csv files/data/data.csv --metadata files/data/data.csv.meta.yaml --outdir files/data/generated
```

A collection of such datapackages can be loaded with the [unitpackage API](https://echemdb.github.io/unitpackage/usage/local_collection.html) to browse, explore, modify or visualize the entries. Here we display the original data of the CSV above with different units.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from unitpackage.collection import Collection

db = Collection.from_local('files/data/generated')
entry = db['data']
entry.rescale({'t':'ms', 'U':'V'}).plot('t', 'U')
```

The metadata from the YAML is also directly accessible.

```{code-cell} ipython3
entry.research_question
```

## Further usage

The standardized unitpackages allow for further integration of research data in different projects. For example, a collection of electrochemical data extracted from the literature is shown on the echemdb website and are directly accessible with API introduced above. In principle this allows direct comparison between published and raw data.

We suggest that locally stored unitpackages are also useful to generate automatically entries in ELNs, which play an important role in RDM workflows.
